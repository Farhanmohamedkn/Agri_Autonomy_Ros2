# Agri Autonomy ROS 2

ROS 2–based autonomy framework for agricultural UGVs and mobile robots.

## Goals
- GPS-based navigation in agricultural environments
- Coverage mission planning (lawnmower patterns)
- Simulation-first development using Gazebo
- Upgrade path to RTK GNSS and multi-sensor fusion

## Scope
This repository focuses on autonomy software for outdoor agricultural robots,
including UGVs. Initial development targets GPS-only navigation
in simulation, followed by higher-precision localization methods.

## Technologies
- ROS 2
- Gazebo
- PX4 / ArduPilot (SITL)
- GNSS (GPS, RTK-ready)
- Sensor fusion (IMU, LiDAR, Camera – future work)

## Status
🚧 Early development (simulation + GPS baseline)
